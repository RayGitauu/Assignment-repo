# Introduction to GitHub for Version Control

This repository was created as part of my assignment on "Introduction to GitHub for Version Control".  
It demonstrates how to use Git and GitHub to manage source code, track changes, and share work online.

# Project Overview

This project includes;
(i) A sample C++ program (`switcth.cpp') that uses a `switch` statement to determine a student’s letter grade based on their numeric input.  
(ii) A README.md file explaining the project purpose and steps followed.

# Learning Objectives

Through this assignment, I learned how to;
1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Clone a repository using Git Bash.
3. Add, commit, and push files to GitHub.
4. Understand basic Git commands like:
   (i)git add
   (ii)git commit
   (iii)git push
   (iv)git pull
   (v)git status

# Technologies Used
I used the programming language C++, Git as a version control system, GitHub for repository hosting and Git Bash as the command line tool in order to add,commit and push the programming file to my GitHub repository. 

# How to Run the Program

To run the program in **switcth.cpp**, follow these steps;
(i) Clone or download this repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/RayGitauu/Assignment-repo.git`
(ii) Move into the project folder:  
  `cd Assignment-repo`
(iii) Compile the program using a C++ compiler (for example, Dev C++):  
  `Dev C++ switcth.cpp -o grade_checker`
(iv) Run the compiled program:  
  `./grade_checker`
- When executed, the program will ask for a numeric grade (0–100) and display the corresponding letter grade (A–E).For example, entering the number 85, the output shall be;  
`Grade: A (Excellent)`
